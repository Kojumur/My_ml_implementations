# My machine learning implementations
My own implementation of machine learning algorithms for educational purposes in python using numpy.  
Terminology used as in course by Andrew Ng https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning  
For running test it is also required to install matplotlib  
  
Currently implemented: logistic and linear regression
